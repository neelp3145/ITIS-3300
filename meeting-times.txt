Meeting 1
Date and time: August 27, 2025,  12 AM - 3 PM
Attendees: Roger Lin, Tyler Quach, Neel Panajkar, Kaksh Patel

One group member, Aayush Niroula, was not present at the meeting due to a time conflict. 
He discussed this with the group beforehand, and we were able to communicate and discuss what we went over online afterwards.

Subjects discussed: As our first meeting, the group reviewed our choice of the project idea from the previous class (a fast food ordering system)
and decided on a name. We discussed the foundational requirements of such a project along with the necessary technology stack. 
Additionally, we began to work on risk management, the project timeline (visualized in the Gantt Chart), and overall planning.


There were no further meetings for this deliverable, although members of the group stayed in constant contact through Discord to finish up 
and polish the report and presentation.
